National governments have invested heavily in experimental\r\nresearch aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times\r\nand lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors\r\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing> (which\r\nisolate an electrical current\r\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_current> by eliminating electrical\r\nresistance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance>) and ion\r\ntraps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer> (which\r\nconfine a single atomic particle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom>\r\nusing electromagnetic\r\nfields <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_fields>).\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Jun 20, 2025 at 11:19\u202fAM vikash kumar <software7.nector@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> A *quantum computer* is a computer\r\n> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer> that exploits quantum mechanical\r\n> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical> phenomena. On small\r\n> scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves\r\n> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality>, and quantum\r\n> computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical\r\n> physics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics> cannot explain\r\n> the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer\r\n> could perform some calculations exponentially\r\n> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth> faster[a]\r\n> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#cite_note-1> than any\r\n> modern \"classical\" computer.
